#WHOIS module for JankBot
By JankDota

To use this module, copy this directory into Jankbot's bot_modules/ directory.

Once the module is installed, you will be able to ask Jankbot to look up
Steam users he is friends with using fuzzy search. This means you do not need
to type the full user's name (unless there are multiple users with similar
names). For example, if you had a friend named 'twisterghost', 'whois twister'
would work, as well as 'whois tg'.
