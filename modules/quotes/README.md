#Quotes module for JankBot
By JankDota

To use this module, copy quotes.js into Jankbot's bot_modules/ directory, then
add it by running 'node config module add' and follow the instructions.

This module is designed to keep a running quote list for your community. Please
note that if Jankbot does not shut down properly, quotes added recently may be
lost.
