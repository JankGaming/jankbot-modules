# Mumble module for Jankbot
By JankDota

**THIS MODULE WAS DESIGNED TO WORK WITH MUMBLE SERVERS HOSTED BY MUMBLE.COM
IF YOU ARE RUNNING YOUR OWN MURMUR INSTANCE YOU MAY NEED TO FIND ALTERNATE
INSTRUCTIONS**

## Setup

Find your mumble JSON CVP url from the 'status on your site' tab on mumble.com's
administration panel. Paste that link into `data/mumbleinfo`. You're ready to go!

Example `data/mumbleinfo`:
