#HeroStats module for JankBot
By JankDota

To use this module, copy this directory into Jankbot's `bot_modules/` directory.

Once the module is installed, you will be able to ask Jankbot to look up hero
information. For example: `herostats AgiGain Phantom Lancer` will look up the
agility gain for Phantom Lancer. You can abbreviate 'herostats' to 'hs'.

You can also be relaxed with capitalization. 'hs agigain phantom lancer' will do
just the same. Who has time to capitalize these days?
